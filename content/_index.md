## DARCLE: Daylong Audio Recordings of Children's Linguistic Environments

### About DARCLE

DARCLE is a group of researchers who collect and/or analyze Daylong Audio Recordings of Children's Linguistic Environments. Some of us are practitioners, others researchers at universities or other public domains, or researchers at companies. We work on a variety of languages and countries (members in USA, Canada, UK, France, Finland, Australia). We are defined by the hope of gaining through collaboration, that is, by sharing expertise and knowledge, and cooperating in the creation of common tools and resources. We are open to people doing any kind of dense recordings (usually audio) as long as their own goals align with ours.
