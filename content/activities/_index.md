<!-- this is a note for future webmaster. -->
<!-- i tentatively added the meeting schedule google doc to this page and hyperlinked it since the doc itself is up-to-date -->

<!-- regarding ongoing projects and past events (archive), i'm unsure if the ongoing projects are actually ongoing, so i'm leaving the section blank for you to fill out. the past events probably need to be updated since the last one on the old website shows an event from 2019. -->

<!-- the old website also included the link to the github repo to the website, i'm not sure this is the best page to keep it? i'd suggest maybe putting it at the bottom of the page either under "Home" or "Contact" page. -->
