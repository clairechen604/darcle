<!-- this is a note for future webmaster. -->

<!-- please add the current board member and all other member info since the info on the old website does not appear to be up-to-date. i'd recommend hyperlinking people's personal websites to their names to avoid clusters. -->

<!-- i'm also unsure of if you'd want to add a separate page for "New Investigators" since it feels like you could just add another subsection for them under the "People" folder. if you want to make a separate page for "New Investigators," simply add a markdown page and edit hugo.toml. -->
